# JS To-Do App

A simple and stylish JavaScript-based To-Do List web application with local storage support. This app allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. The tasks persist in the browser's local storage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- Add tasks to the list
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Tasks persist using local storage
- Responsive and minimal design

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

```
js-todo-app/
├── index.html   # Main HTML file
├── styles.css   # Styling file
└── script.js    # JavaScript logic
```

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HarishVijendiran1997/js-todo-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd js-todo-app
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## How It Works

1. Enter a task in the input field.
2. Click the **Add Task** button to add it to the list.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed (strikethrough effect).
4. Click the **Delete** button to remove a task.
5. The tasks are stored in `localStorage`, so they persist across page reloads.
